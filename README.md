1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

Answer: I would choose 2, manually run them locally before pushing code. I think incrementally testing your code unlike #3 which is rawdogging your code hoping it's all working. As for #1, I honestly liked it when I remember we were using this on github to test. But I think it would be more efficient to run the tests locally instead of having to push each time to test. 

2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
No, but I haven't been able to try it out until this lab. Maybe my answer would change after.
